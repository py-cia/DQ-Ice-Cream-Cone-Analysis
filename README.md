# dq-ice-cream-cone-analysis

# Description
This project used R shiny to analyze Dairy Queen ice cream cones of different sizes from several employees. This project aimed to identify the employee with the best accuracy and precision. All else equal, the idea was that an employee who was consistent and spot on with their measurements would also save the company money by using the ice cream mix efficiently. The differences between employee averages were small but could potentially lead to savings in the future.
# Challenges
The window I had to complete this project was short, so the data I collected was insufficient to compare employees fairly. I conducted this project while away
at school, so I could not monitor the progress or fidelity of the results. The last challenge was an implicit bias; when employees weigh their cones, they want to be accurate so that when one cone is far off, there is a mental note that the next one should have more or less ice cream.

# Future
I might rework the interface again; I learned about shinydashboards while trying to customize this app, and i think that will improve the ui.
